# Welcome to the VSIX University!

Our goal at the VSIX University is to help teach the complicated world of Visual Studio extensibility / development. If you've attempted a Visual Studio extension in the past, or already have one publicly available, you know the difficulties that go into this niche software development practice. 

## Goals

1. Provide a searchable registry of Visual Studio extensions, available through the GitHub API, to help narrow down the window of finding existing projects to get inspiration or knowledge from, when the Visual Studio SDK documentation just isn't enough (and it rarely is!).
2. Then, extending that registry by classifying each project with the SDK features they're utilizing, thus providing a more robust way of filtering the projects to find samples that implement very specific functionality you need. Need a project that implements CodeLens? Here they are. Need a project that implements an LSP client? Here they are.
3. Provide discreet tips & tricks, sample projects, and easy-to-use documentation to help build the next evolution of Visual Studio extensions!
4. Provide packages that can be pulled into your codebase to make interacting with the VSSDK even easier and more streamlined.
5. Create a community of Visual Studio extensibility authors to talk to, share information, and help out.
